# Accelerating Emergency Response: An Optimized Ambulance Dispatch Model for Manhattan

## Project Overview
This project examines optimization strategies to minimize ambulance response times in Manhattan: a min-sum model, a min-max model, and robust versions of both. The goal is to improve emergency medical services (EMS) efficiency while addressing equity and uncertainty challenges. Our approach integrates real-world constraints to provide actionable recommendations for dispatch optimization.

## Methods
- **Min-Sum Model**: Minimizes total response time across all incidents.
- **Min-Max Model**: Minimizes the worst-case response time to ensure equitable service distribution.
- **Robust Optimization**: Incorporates demand and capacity uncertainties to improve system resilience.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Identifies critical stations where resource allocation can improve response times.

## Key Insights
- The **Min-Sum model** achieves the lowest total wait time but does not directly address equity concerns.
- The **Min-Max model** ensures fairness but results in longer overall wait times.
- The **Robust models** trade off efficiency for stability, better handling uncertainty in emergency demand.
- **Sensitivity analysis** identified bottleneck stations where increasing capacity can significantly improve response times.
